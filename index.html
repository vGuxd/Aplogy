    <div class="text">
    <p >First of all I am really sorry about the past few days or the past month that you had to get thrugh with me, I know I was the problem all these days and I wanted to appologize for all of that because I love you so much and I can't live without you.
       <br> <br><p>I always want the best for you and the best for us and I'm trying to be a better person for you. I never wanted to hurt you or make you feel the way you are feeling bout me these days, I know it's going to take time for you to build all the trust again but we'll get thrugh it and all that will be past.</p>
        <br><p>I want you to know that you are and will be the only person that I love you from the bottom of my heart and you are not replaceable, I know that you think that I don't trust you or something like that but you are completely wrong about it because I trust you more than anything in this world I just don't have my thoughts clear and when I don't talk about something it means that I don't know that it is important to you but from now on I will talk with you about anything and everything.</p>
        <br><p>Don't forget that no matter what happens I love you so much and my love for you will never change in fact it will only get better but never worse.</p>
        <br><p>I am not waiting for you to accept my appologies right now, I just wanted you to know all of that.
        I was planning to write you a letter for your birthday but since something happened yesterday I had to write it down today.</p>
         I hope all that make something clear and you forgive me just a little bit.
         <br><br><p>Well now if you are questioning when or how I did that I have been doing that all the time we've been on call thats why I didn't talk much haha I was trying to get all these words out and I'm writing all that and you are looking at me being mad thinking that I don't care but I do more than anything, I apologies for that too that I didn't talk. </p>
